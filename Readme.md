In this blog I will write my programming notes. so that I can revise it sometimes. Visitors can also refesh thier memory about thier learning of any programing languages/ frameworks/ tools. Anyone can read through some of the blog/notes about a specific technology before starting a project with using that technology. 

You can find here:
- notes about a specific programing language (eg. python, kotlin, typescript, c++, sql)
- notes about a specific library (eg. tkinter, lifecycle)
- notes about a specific database (eg. postgres, firebase)
- notes about a specific development tools (eg. android studio)
- notes about specific topic (eg. osi model)
