Hi, I am **Prince Billy Graham Karmoker**. I am working as a full-time software engineer. You are getting help from these blogs as I also use these blogs to refresh my memory every time I start a new project or have to work with a specific tool/ programming language project after long days.
<br>
Here are some things that you can get here:

* **Code spinets** (eg. docker-compose)
* **Programming language** review/notes (eg. kotlin, c++, typescirpt)
* **Cheat-sheets** for specific library (eg. tkinter)
* **How to** do some special things (eg. adding google ads in jekyll)
* Tricks to solve programming problems etc.
* **Download various cheat-sheets**
